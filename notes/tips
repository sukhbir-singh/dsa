- when sending array indexes as parameters, better to send actual inclusive indexes. This will help in avoiding out of index errors.

- always calculate mid point using subtraction, other wise additiona can cause out of range for integer.
`int mid = st + (end-st)/2;`

- reverse array algorithm.
// remember that while reversing you have to iterate to only half
for (int i=0; i<totalElements/2; i++) {
    swap(nums, i, nums.length-1-i);
}

- (Very Important) Difference between two elements in cummulative sum array = Sum of elements between those positions in the original array.
